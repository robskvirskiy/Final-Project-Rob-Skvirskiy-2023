# Final-Project-Rob-Skvirskiy-2023

For my Final Project, I made a variation of my Final Project that I did before for this class, which was based off a tutorial video on YouTube. I changed up a bunch of things this time and made it even more different and way better. I changed the overall game to be a Philadelphia 76ers style pong game, where one side is the 76ers and the other side is the Celtics. I obviously changed the colors to accomadate this. I also changed a bunch of other stuff such as making the screen bigger, changing the ball speed and color, changed the paddle speed and size, changed the boundaries of where the ball can hit and where the ball can score.
